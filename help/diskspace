# When extra space needed

- Removed 14G last time


## ~/Code 

- Delete some old projects
- Delete tmp-test-repos if it exists
- Temporarily get space back by deleting node_modules of repos you'll eventually get back to
- Look for projects that create images or large files


## /nix/store

`nix-store --gc`


## ~/Library/Caches

- Look for unnecessary caches (like Yarn)


## ~/Library/Containers

- Docker keeps a really large cache

`docker system prune -a`


## Personal data (~/Pictures and ~/Library/Messages)

Check settings so that messages and photos are not kept around
